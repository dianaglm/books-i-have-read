# books-i-have-read
A list of books I've read in recent years and titles I've remembered since I was a child

You can see the live version here: https://mystifying-lumiere-54d864.netlify.app/.

Each color means something:
<ul>
  <li>Green - one of my favorite books</li>
  <li>Red - love story</li>
  <li>Yellow - travel book</li>
  <li>Purle - mystery book</li>
  <li>Blue - I liked the book but it's not really my favorite</li>
</ul>

The titles are still in Romanian, my native language, but I will change that later
